tetris

This is a game I created with my classmate Timmy(Jinyao) Lu and Ryan Misiak.

Instructions

A game of tetris consists of a board, 11 columns wide and 15 rows high. Blocks consisting of
four cells (tetrominoes) appear at the top of the screen, and you must drop them onto the board
so as not to leave any gaps. Once an entire row has been filled, it disappears, and the blocks above
move down by one unit.

Level 0: Takes its blocks in sequence
from the file sequence.txt. This level is non-random.
Level 1: The block selector will randomly choose a block with probabilities skewed such that
S and Z blocks are selected with probability 1
12 each, and the other blocks are selected with
probability 1
6 each.
 Level 2: All blocks are selected with equal probability.
 Level 3: The block selector will randomly choose a block with probabilities skewed such that
S and Z blocks are selected with probability 2
9 each, and the other blocks are selected with
probability 1
9 each. Moreover, blocks generated in level 3 are \heavy": every command to
move or rotate the block will be followed immediately and automatically by a downward move
of one row (if possible).
 Level 4: In addition to the rules of Level 3, in Level 4 there is an external constructive force:
every time you place 5 (and also 10, 15, etc.) blocks without clearing at least one row, a
1x1 block (indicated by * in text, and by the colour brown in graphics) is dropped onto your
game board in the centre column. Once dropped, it acts like any other block: if it completes
a row, the row disappears. So if you do not act quickly, these blocks will work to eventually
split your screen in two, making the game difficult to play.


Getting Started

Install all .h, .cc,files and link and compile on terminal. The following are the commands to play the game:

 "left" moves the current block one cell to the left. If this is not possible (left edge of the board,
or block in the way), the command has no effect.
 "right" as above, but to the right.
 "down" as above, but one cell downward.
 "clockwise" rotates the block 90 degrees clockwise, as described earlier. If the rotation cannot
be accomplished without coming into contact with existing blocks, the command has no effect.
 "counterclockwise" as above, but counterclockwise.
 "drop" drops the current block. It is (in one step) moved downward as far as possible until
it comes into contact with either the bottom of the board or a block. This command also
triggers the next block to appear. Even if a block is already as far down as it can go (as a
result of executing the down command), it still needs to be dropped in order to get the next
block.
 "levelup" Increases the difficulty level of the game by one. The block showing as next still
comes next, but subsequent blocks are generated using the new level. If there is no higher
level, this command has no efect.
 "leveldown" Decreases the difficulty level of the game by one. The block showing as next still
comes next, but subsequent blocks are generated using the new level. If there is no lower
level, this command has no effect.
 "norandom" file Relevant only during levels 3 and 4, this command makes these levels non-
random, instead taking input from the sequence file, starting from the beginning. This is
to facilitate testing.
"random" Relevant only during levels 3 and 4, this command restores randomness in these levels.
 "sequence" file Executes the sequence of commands found in file. This is to facilitate the
construction of test cases. "I, J, L, etc." Useful during testing, these commands replace the current undropped block with
the stated block. Heaviness is detemined by the level number. Note that, for heavy blocks,
these commands do not cause a downward move.
 "restart" Clears the board and starts a new game.
 "p" drops the block
